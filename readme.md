I recently completed a mechatronics project that demonstrates the power of technology and innovation. Using NodeMCU and an ultrasonic sensor, I created a car that can be controlled remotely via a simple webpage accessed through an IP address.

Remote Control: My project enables users to control the car from anywhere, offering convenience and accessibility.

Obstacle Avoidance: Safety is a top priority, and my project incorporates obstacle avoidance technology, ensuring smooth and secure operation.

Future Expansion: Looking ahead, I'm planning to enhance this project by integrating an ESP32-CAM module. This addition will enable video streaming on the webserver, opening up new possibilities for real-time monitoring and control.
